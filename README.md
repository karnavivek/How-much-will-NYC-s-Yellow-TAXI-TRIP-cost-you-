# How Much Will NYC's Yellow Taxi Trip Cost You???

How much will NYC's Yellow TAXI TRIP cost you? 

Hmmm, Imagine you are new to NYC! You have been advised to travel via metro or any other public transport by the locals! They say "Getting a Taxi costs a lot in New York city! I don't recommend it :("

We being a Data Scientist, will take the matter on our own hands! 
We will deduce the hypothesis ourselves, is NYC's Taxi really costly??

Join this Advanced Data exploration with me in finding out this question with 3 million datapoints!

We will look into the following steps:
- Data Cleaning
  - Treating Missing Values, NaN Values etc.
  - Taking care of outliers
  - Creating New features with Feature Engineering
- Deducing observations with Data Visualization
- Applying Regression on Data via popular scikit-learn
- Modelling Neural Network & Decision Trees to get better predictions
